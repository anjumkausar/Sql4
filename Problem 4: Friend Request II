# Write your MySQL query statement below
WITH CTE AS (
    SELECT requester_id AS 'r1' from RequestAccepted
    UNION ALL
    SELECT accepter_id AS 'r1' from RequestAccepted
),
ACTE AS(
    SELECT r1 AS 'id', COUNT(r1) AS 'num' FROM CTE GROUP BY 1
    #Can also use PARTITION BY
    #SELECT DISTINCT r1 AS 'id', COUNT(r1) OVER(PARTITION BY r1) AS 'num' FROM CTE
)
SELECT id, num FROM ACTE WHERE num=(SELECT max(num) FROM ACTE);
#Can also use LIMIT
#SELECT id, num FROM ACTE ORDER BY num DESC LIMIT 1;

#Approach-2 Using one CTE
WITH CTE AS(
    SELECT requester_id AS 'id', (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM RequestAccepted WHERE id = requester_id OR id = accepter_id) AS 'num' FROM RequestAccepted
    UNION ALL
    SELECT accepter_id AS 'id', (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM RequestAccepted WHERE id = requester_id OR id = accepter_id) AS 'num' FROM RequestAccepted
)
SELECT * FROM CTE ORDER BY num DESC LIMIT 1;
